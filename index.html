                    of the DigiDestined during the adventure into the Digital World six years ago. His strong sense of
                    justice and his straightforward earnest side haven't changed since elementary school, but lately
                    he's also been worrying about where he's headed in life.

                    warm-hearted and thoughtful of his friends. That straightforwardness sometimes leads to his opinions
                    clashing with Taichi's. Yamato's been in a band since junior high, playing bass and singing vocals.
                    Perhaps due to musical differences with the other members, Teen-Age Wolves has temporarily broken
                    up. He recently formed a new band.

                    kindness and sensitivity to be considerate of others, along with a strong sense of responsibility.
                    Sora is something of a "big sister" figure that keeps the peace within the group, such as when she

                    DigiDestined all over the world, but he also has a tendency to get too wrapped up in the gathering
                    of knowledge and information, thus making him lose sight of his surroundings.
